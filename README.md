# Remix + React Native Web

Experiments integrating React Native Web (RNW) into a Remix app.

Discussion: [Usage with React Native (+ Web)](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/1578)

## Current branch: main [![Open in CodeSandbox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-CodeSandbox-blue?style=flat-square&logo=codesandbox)](https://githubbox.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/blob/main/app/routes/index.tsx)

This is a "Just the basics" Remix app with the sole addition of a single
react-native-web `View` (see [./app/routes/index.tsx](./app/routes/index.tsx)).
Adding the `View` results in a hydration error:

```
Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching <meta> in <head>.
```

This hydration error does not occur in a simple create-react-app+SSR app
that I made to try to re-create the issue â€”

### Versions

- @remix-run/\*: ^1.7.2

## Branches

- [main](https://github.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/tree/main)
  - A "Just the basics" Remix app with the sole addition of a single
    react-native-web `View`.
  - Encounters a hydration error ("Expected... matching &lt;meta&gt; in &lt;head&gt;")
  - [![Open in CodeSandbox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-CodeSandbox-blue?style=flat-square&logo=codesandbox)](https://githubbox.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/blob/main/app/routes/index.tsx)
- [mod-remix-resolve-configs](https://github.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/tree/mod-remix-resolve-configs)
  - Uses a [modded version of @remix-run/dev](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/compare/main...mikeylemmon:remix:config-add-resolve-opts)
    to enable compatibility with community packages that utilize react-native-web
  - Encounters the same hydration error as the main branch
  - [![Open in CodeSandbox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in-CodeSandbox-blue?style=flat-square&logo=codesandbox)](https://githubbox.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/blob/mod-remix-resolve-configs/app/routes/index.tsx)
- [horus-styles](https://github.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/tree/horus-styles)
  - Attempt to get react-native-web SSR styles working by roughly following
    sections 2. and 3. of Horus Lugo's blog post
    [How to Setup React Native Web in a Remix project](https://horus.dev/blog/react-native-web-remix-setup)
  - Encounters a different hydration error, reported by Horus:
    [necolas/react-native-web#2326](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web/issues/2326)
    - That issue was closed based on a misreading of Horus's code, but it
      remains unclear if the source of the issue is in react-native-web, on
      on the remix side, or is related to the specific way that SSR is
      implemented in Horus's example.

- [tyrauber-styles](https://github.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/tree/tyrauber-styles)
  - This branch is very similar to the
    [horus-styles](https://github.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/tree/horus-styles)
    branch, but uses
    [Ty Rauber's code](https://github.com/tyrauber/remix-expo/tree/main/apps/remix/app
    for server-side RNW styles instead of Horus Lugo's
    ([diff](https://github.com/mikeylemmon/remix-rnw/compare/horus-styles...tyrauber-styles)).
    The hydration errors are the same.

# Welcome to Remix!

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

### Using a Template

When you ran `npx create-remix@latest` there were a few choices for hosting. You can run that again to create a new project, then copy over your `app/` folder to the new project that's pre-configured for your target server.

```sh
cd ..
# create a new project, and pick a pre-configured host
npx create-remix@latest
cd my-new-remix-app
# remove the new project's app (not the old one!)
rm -rf app
# copy your app over
cp -R ../my-old-remix-app/app app
```
